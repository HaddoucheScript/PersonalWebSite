    <p> I'm a teacher and researcher in physics. I taught general physics, electromagnetism and optics, algorithms and TCE (expression techniques in french).
        My field of research was the 'nuclear structure' . Since about 6 years, I changed my field of interest and I'm now working on quantum supersymmetry.<br>
        In addition to physics, I'm fascinated by many other fields including philosophy and hobbies like martial arts.
        I'm working as a teacher at the National School of Built and Ground Works Inginering in Algiers and as 
        member of Theoretical Physics at USTHB university, Algiers.

       <h1>Where I studied since my childhood?</h1>
       <body>
        My first day of school was in September 1985 (I was just 5 years old) at Moufdi Zakaria primary school in Ben Choubene, Rouiba (Algiers). 
       I studied after that at Ahmed Aroua middle school (in the same location). Finally I went to Abdeslam Habachi and then
       Abdelmoumen High schools in Rouiba.
       After having the Baccalaurius, I enrolled at Houari Boumédien University of Science and Technology in Bab Ezzouar (Algiers), 
       where I studied physics.
